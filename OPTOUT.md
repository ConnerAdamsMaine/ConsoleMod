   - Protect hobby developers from AI commercialization

2. **Prevent Unauthorized Use**

   - Prevent large corporations from using free code for AI training
   - Stop extraction of code for proprietary AI systems
   - Prevent monetization of human-created work through AI
   - Ensure fair use principles are respected

3. **Maintain Project Intent**

   - Keep ConsoleMod as a human education tool
   - Prevent conversion into AI training data
   - Preserve the hobby nature of the project
   - Respect the original creator's vision

4. **Protect Community**

   - Stop AI systems trained on ConsoleMod
   - Prevent AI-generated versions claiming to be ConsoleMod
   - Protect attribution and credit
   - Prevent AI-generated derivatives

5. **Ethical Concerns**
   - AI training on unconsentced human work is unethical
   - Conversion to AI without permission is violation
   - Hobby projects should remain human-focused

## FAQ

### Q: Can I use ConsoleMod as reference for training my AI?

**A:** No. Reference material for AI training is still AI training. Not permitted.

### Q: What about indirect use - like using AI to understand ConsoleMod first?

**A:** Still prohibited. Any AI involvement in preparation for AI training is not allowed.

### Q: Can a developer use AI to write ConsoleMod code?

**A:** That's between the developer and the license terms. But once generated, that code cannot then be used for AI training.

### Q: What if my company accidentally included ConsoleMod in training data?

**A:** Contact consolemod@404development.dev immediately with details. Accidental inclusion requires notification and remediation plan.

### Q: Can I request permission for AI training use?

**A:** Yes, email consolemod@404development.dev. Permission is not automatically granted and will be evaluated case-by-case.

### Q: What about educational AI projects?

**A:** Educational use must be human-centric. If the AI is trained on ConsoleMod, not permitted. If AI helps teach humans about ConsoleMod, may be different - contact for clarification.

### Q: Does this apply to old versions?

**A:** Yes, all versions of ConsoleMod (including before this policy was added) have this restriction.

### Q: What about forks or derivatives?

**A:** Forks created under 404_CM-v1.0 inherit this restriction. Derivatives must comply.

### Q: Can web scrapers collect ConsoleMod for AI?

**A:** No. Automated collection for AI training violates this policy.

### Q: What about mirror sites?

**A:** Creating mirrors to distribute ConsoleMod for AI training violates this policy.

### Q: Does this prevent me from using ConsoleMod for projects?

**A:** No. You can use ConsoleMod in applications. You just can't train AI on it.

### Q: What if ConsoleMod is already in a dataset I'm using?

**A:** Remove it immediately and notify consolemod@404development.dev if it was collected for your purposes.
